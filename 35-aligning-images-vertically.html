      For the most part, the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica), also known as
      the common puffin, is a species of seabird in the auk family. It is the
      only puffin native to the Atlantic Ocean; two related species, the tufted
      puffin and the horned puffin, are found in the northeastern Pacific. The
      Atlantic puffin breeds in Russia, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Greenland,
      Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and the Faroe Islands, and as far
      south as Maine in the west and France in the east.
